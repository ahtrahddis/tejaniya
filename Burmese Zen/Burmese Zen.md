# About this e-book

[Burmese Zen](http://tejaniyasayadaw.space/burmese-zen) is an unofficial collection of excerpts by [Sayadaw U Tejaniya](https://ashintejaniya.org/), created by the people behind [Wisdom's Roar](http://tejaniyasayadaw.space/).

# Preface

Rare indeed is to come across utterances that can cut through the veil of delusion in our minds upon hearing them. We trust the collectable quotes below transcribed in verbatim from talks given by Tejaniya Sayadaw will do that job – shifting the mind from doubt to Right Understanding.


# Excerpts


If you know the mind, you will notice seeing and looking happening all the time.

<center>—∗—</center>

Defilement is already doing its job. When we can observe the defilement, also notice that awareness-wisdom is doing its job too.

<center>—∗—</center>

You have benefited (effect) as much as you have practiced (cause); a yogi who understands cause and effect is not greedy.

<center>—∗—</center>

Don't push too much – be aware gently and patiently. It is precious indeed to find a patient yogi!

<center>—∗—</center>

A thought is just a thought, a feeling is just a feeling because reality does its job and it dies.

<center>—∗—</center>

When there is tension, the mind is watching with craving.

<center>—∗—</center>

If you care to be aware, meditation is already happening. It doesn’t have to be a particular object.

<center>—∗—</center>

Every object is very simple; it’s only thinking that makes it complicated.

<center>—∗—</center>

When the mind is close to the object, you cannot see the complete picture.

<center>—∗—</center>

The thought may be the same, but the thinking mind is always new.

<center>—∗—</center>

Awareness is new kamma. Experience is old kamma; so keep going on.

<center>—∗—</center>

When there is identification, emotions arise. So, check your idea.

<center>—∗—</center>

Wisdom is not involved with the object. Wisdom stays far away from the object.

<center>—∗—</center>

Object is already there. You know what is happening if you have awareness.

<center>—∗—</center>

If there is no practice, it is difficult to have the Dhamma.

<center>—∗—</center>

Looking is not seeing outside things. Looking is the mind thinking of the object.

<center>—∗—</center>

If you want to practice, just be aware moment to moment.

<center>—∗—</center>

If you’re aware moment to moment, you learn a lot every day.

<center>—∗—</center>

If you can’t change the attitude, change the object because if you can’t step back, you can’t observe.

<center>—∗—</center>

The meditating mind stays with the awareness, not with the experience.

<center>—∗—</center>

Awareness is the meditating mind, the 5 Spiritual Faculties. 

<center>—∗—</center>

However much you practice, you have already progressed by that much – nothing less and nothing more.

<center>—∗—</center>

When the mind is aware of a defilement with right view, the defilement is removed from the mind.

<center>—∗—</center>

When you put energy into the awareness, you take energy out of the defilement.

<center>—∗—</center>

When awareness is weak, the mind cannot learn.

<center>—∗—</center>

Meditation and eagerness are opposites.

<center>—∗—</center>

Every time a defilement comes, wait and watch. Make it a habit.

<center>—∗—</center>

When we pay attention without right view, defilement increases.

<center>—∗—</center>

Don’t set targets in your practice.

<center>—∗—</center>

Defilements are everywhere – everyday you take a hot shower, but with what mind you don’t know. 

<center>—∗—</center>

Right attitude for home practice – any awareness doesn’t go to waste.

<center>—∗—</center>

Stopping runaway wandering mind – watch your intention to think. Because of intention, thinking continues, right?

<center>—∗—</center>

Meditation awareness observes the 6 senses, not concepts.

<center>—∗—</center>

The mind should not think that calmness is good because it also changes. Experience is just experience, just an object. 

<center>—∗—</center>

Boredom arises because of craving.

<center>—∗—</center>

When we do something repeatedly, momentum will build up naturally – that’s natural effort.

<center>—∗—</center>

Many yogis tell me that meditation is difficult. What they are actually saying is that they cannot get what they want.

<center>—∗—</center>

When meditation is difficult, craving is the problem.

<center>—∗—</center>

If you have right view, samadhi is already there. Wisdom, awareness and effort are the causes, right samadhi is the effect.

<center>—∗—</center>

Awareness-wisdom meditation is a life-long practice. There is no short cut to enlightenment. In another words, the mind quality improves like growing a new business, not like striking lottery. 

<center>—∗—</center>

Meditators want to meditate well – that’s why a lot of tension, depression and boredom arise.

<center>—∗—</center>

Every time you feel something pleasant or unpleasant, you start watching how it feels. Make it a habit.

<center>—∗—</center>

Stay with the awareness. Remember that awareness is important, object is not important.

<center>—∗—</center>

You will get attached to whatever you do again and again without awareness and wisdom. This is the nature of delusion.

<center>—∗—</center>

You cannot avoid defilements. Welcome them and learn from them.

<center>—∗—</center>

When there is no understanding, the object and the mind appear as one.

<center>—∗—</center>

If you use energy to focus on the object, the mind starts to think what the object looks like; then it becomes a concept, something the mind imagines.

<center>—∗—</center>

Many yogis want to meditate but they don’t want to meditate all the time. That’s why they cannot improve.

<center>—∗—</center>

We’re not trying to remove the defilements and suffering. The process of purification is happening through the watching. 

<center>—∗—</center>

If you’re not aware, the mind is deluded; and when there is delusion, any defilement can arise.

<center>—∗—</center>

Any time your mental, verbal and physical actions have awareness and wisdom, you are secure.

<center>—∗—</center>

When a thought agitates the mind and makes it suffer, don’t believe or follow the thought. It is a nonsensical thought.

<center>—∗—</center>

Don’t try to create anything and don’t reject what is happening – just be aware.

<center>—∗—</center>

You are not trying to make things turn out the way you want – you’re trying to know what is happening as it is.

<center>—∗—</center>

When we notice we have wrong view, that’s right view.

<center>—∗—</center>

The mind never goes here or far way – just paying attention mind is happening and gone.

<center>—∗—</center>

Don’t let things happen automatically – know and let the mind choose.

<center>—∗—</center>

When there is the idea of ‘self’ that takes things personally, then the defilement increases.

<center>—∗—</center>

Defilements trick us into not wanting to meditate.

<center>—∗—</center>

Whatever you know in the present moment is absolutely fine because it is being known and you’re meditating.

<center>—∗—</center>

If you’re aware, that’s enough. No need to focus, no need to try hard.

<center>—∗—</center>

If we are in a hurry, we lose mindfulness.

<center>—∗—</center>

Only with mindfulness meditation can you do two things at one time, even in the toilet!

<center>—∗—</center>

Vipassana object must be natural – therefore, you don’t try to control the experience.

<center>—∗—</center>

There’s no meditation in the future that we need to be doing; we just need to be doing it now.

<center>—∗—</center>

Awareness does not use focusing.

<center>—∗—</center>

When we practice in daily life and we’re successful, we truly, truly experience the benefits of the Dhamma.

<center>—∗—</center>

Awareness is not ‘I’ – it is a function of the mind.

<center>—∗—</center>

When sati is present, wisdom can arise. If you do that all the time, the mind can only get better and better.

<center>—∗—</center>

Don’t think ‘I’m good because my meditation is good’. Think: I’m good because I’m aware’.

<center>—∗—</center>

You don’t try to see harder; you don’t try to look closer. You just have to wait for the glasses to become clear. 

<center>—∗—</center>

The meditator is not concerned about the object, or how clear the object should be; he is concerned about how to be aware and how to keep the awareness continuous. 

<center>—∗—</center>

If you know how to make money, you’re not afraid to lose money.<br>
(If the mind knows how to be aware, it is not afraid when awareness is lost.)

<center>—∗—</center>

If we know nature, we can use nature. The mind is also nature.

<center>—∗—</center>

If we know the mind, we can use the mind wisely.

<center>—∗—</center>

Mindfulness only happens now, not in the future.

<center>—∗—</center>

When you eat, enjoy the understanding, not the food.

<center>—∗—</center>

If you don’t know the mind, it can never rest because liking and disliking are pushing all the time.

<center>—∗—</center>

Yogis need to value the awareness and not complain about the experience.

<center>—∗—</center>

There’s no need to force to know because the mind already knows.

<center>—∗—</center>

The mind cannot stop liking and disliking even until you die if you do not know the mind.

<center>—∗—</center>

When the mind stays with the experience, liking and disliking arise, but when the mind stays with the awareness, the awareness grows stronger and stronger.

<center>—∗—</center>

Meditation is difficult because of craving and expectation.

<center>—∗—</center>

Craving always wants the result. Wisdom pays attention to the causes.

<center>—∗—</center>

Vipassana samadhi is not afraid of the object.

<center>—∗—</center>

I’m a good meditator because I can be aware, not because I have special experiences.

<center>—∗—</center>

If the mind cannot separate from the object, then wisdom is not there yet.

<center>—∗—</center>

All defilements pay attention to concepts; wisdom pays attention to nature/reality.

<center>—∗—</center>

We eat food with craving our whole life long – food is a craving object

<center>—∗—</center>

If you open your eyes, you cannot over focus because 80% of the time the mind’s attention naturally goes to the eyes.

<center>—∗—</center>

If you have peace (samadhi) without wisdom, you become attached.

<center>—∗—</center>

Peace is not important; absence of suffering is important.

<center>—∗—</center>

We use the object to grow our awareness; the object is not important.

<center>—∗—</center>

When any understanding arises, the defilements become weaker and weaker.

<center>—∗—</center>

Whenever the mind recognizes that awareness is present, the awareness becomes better and better.

<center>—∗—</center>

Thinking that meditation is good or bad because of a particular place, posture or time is nonsense.

<center>—∗—</center>

Because of right attitude, any place, posture and time is always good for meditation.

<center>—∗—</center>

Every time you are mindful, you must check if you have right view.

<center>—∗—</center>

If you practice the right way, the mind must be pleasant and light because of wholesome mind. But if your practice is very tiring, suffering a lot, then something is wrong.

<center>—∗—</center>
